# reactify-player
This is a Spotify web player app created using React and Spotify's web API. To access the online version, click [here](https://keeganosler.github.io/reactify-player).

## Instructions
To use this app you will need to have a Spotify account (free or premium) in order to obtain the Spotify access token needed to use the web player.  It will look like the following:

Once you have pasted this access token in to the box, start playing Spotify on your mobile device.  I suggest opening the page for accessing your token in a new tab from the one the player is being hosted on in order to make the copy/pasting process easier.

Select "Devices Available" then choose "Keegan's Spotify Player" to begin playing music through the Reactify Player. It will look something like this:

## Future Work and Extensions
I would like toenable the ability to pull the album artwork for a given song as well as the song name, artist name and album title.  Implementing a draggable/scrollable song progress bar as well would also be useful.

This project utilizes the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and was heavily inspired by [this](https://mbell.me/blog/2017-12-29-react-spotify-playback-api/) tutorial by Matt Bell.
